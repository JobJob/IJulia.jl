Returns a function, that, when invoked, will only be triggered at most once during a given window of time.
Normally, the throttled function will run as much as it can, without ever going more than once per wait duration;
but if youâ€™d like to disable the execution on the leading edge, pass leading=false.
To disable execution on the trailing edge, ditto.
